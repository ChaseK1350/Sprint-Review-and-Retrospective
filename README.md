# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

User needs are essentially an analysis of the program. They offer insight into what I can change with the program to better fit them and improve the user's experience. Through feedback such as user stories, I can find specific, key points in the program that need improving or changing. User stories describe in detail the pieces of the program that could be added or changed and this feedback comes straight from the users. I can figure out how to modify or create specific features, continuously testing the new features to ensure that they satisfy the user needs. 

# How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

When I approach developing, I am looking to be constantly integrating and testing. This aligns with the Agile approach as I am interested in making sure my programs are working while moving forward, rather than completing a program and waiting until the end to test the product as a whole. Some different Agile processes that I hope to incorporate in the future are very key concepts such as generating user stories and incorporating Agile ceremonies to improve communication amongst the team.

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member is staying active throughout development. This does not mean that I finish the work assigned to me and move on, but rather I effectively communicate with the rest of the team both the work I have done and lend help where needed. A good teammate not only communicates and works with other team members, but my role should be able to reach other parts of the development, offering help and potentially learning other parts of development. By doing so, the team will trust me and hopefully understand that they rely on me to try my best in anything that is asked of me.
